                  For over 61 years. E. E. Jensen has specialized in sprinkler installations and repairs to residential, commercial, industrial and municipal properties. For the last 20 years E. E. Jensen has also expanded into landscaping, low voltage lighting and yard drainage. Our insured staff is well-trained to provide the highest standard to work, with care for neatness and efficiency. Our history in the San Gabriel valley serves us well, as the company has established a reputation for quality products, fast and reliable service and competitive price. Emil E. Jensen entered the sprinkler business in Pasadena , 1947, during a postwar era when materials were difficult to find.   The company, E. E. Jensen, moved to Arcadia two years later, operating out of the rear of the family house, and gradually grew in personnel and equipment.  The ‘ 50 ’ s brought more recognizability with the introduction of the trademark yellow and black trucks and later, expansion into municipal work.</td>       <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img src="images/ee-sign100.jpg" alt="EEJ"></td>     </tr>    </tbody></table> <br> <table width="90%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">        <tbody><tr>       <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img src="images/ee-truck.jpg" alt="EEJ"></td>       <td style="vertical-align: top;">Most of the median strips on Huntington Drive running through San Marino and South Pasadena , and on Lake Avenue in Pasadena , were installed by E. E. Jensen during the period. 1959 saw a major move to a new facility on Mountain Avenue in Monrovia . Emil Jensen died in 1972, but his plans for the business were furthered by his son, Ernest E. Jensen. The business grew and moved again to still larger facilities, at 1963 South Myrtle Avenue in Monrovia. With the move came the expansion into landscaping. </td></tr></tbody></table><br />
